    description: "The Cupra Born is the first all-electric vehicle from SEAT's performance-oriented Cupra sub-brand. Built on Volkswagen Group's MEB platform shared with the VW ID.3, it features distinctive, aggressive styling that sets it apart from its Volkswagen cousin. The exterior showcases Cupra's design language with sharp lines, copper accents, and sportier details including a more pronounced front splitter and diffuser. Available with several battery and motor configurations, the lineup typically includes a 45 kWh battery with 150 HP, a 58 kWh battery with 204 HP, and a 77 kWh battery also with 204 HP. A performance e-Boost version increases output to 231 HP and enables 0-100 km/h acceleration in approximately 6.6 seconds. Range varies by battery size, with the 77 kWh version offering up to 548 km (340 miles) on the WLTP cycle. Charging capabilities include support for up to 125 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 5-80% charge in around 35 minutes for the larger battery versions. The interior features sports seats with recycled materials, a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen, and a digital instrument cluster, all with Cupra's distinctive copper accents and sporty design elements. The suspension is tuned for more engaging handling compared to the ID.3, with standard sports suspension that's 15mm lower and the option of Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive damping. The Born represents Cupra's vision for performance-oriented electric mobility, offering a more emotionally engaging alternative to mainstream EVs while maintaining the efficiency and sustainability benefits of electric propulsion."
